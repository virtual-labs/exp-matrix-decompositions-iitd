### The simulations are structured into three distinct sections: Matrix Operations, System of Equations Calculator, and Matrix Decompositions. For each segment, you may input your matrix element values either in the provided textarea directly or within individual cells. In the textarea, matrix elements should be separated by spaces, with new rows initiated by pressing the Enter key. To switch to cell input mode, simply activate the cell option in the simulator. Once the matrix values are entered, select the desired operation—such as Determinant, Trace, Eigenvalue Decomposition, or LU Decomposition—by clicking the corresponding button.
