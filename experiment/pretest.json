      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That would be symmetric, not orthogonal.",
        "b": "Correct. Orthogonal matrices satisfy A^T = A⁻¹ by definition.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Orthogonal matrices have determinant ±1.",

        "c": "Incorrect. That’s the sum of some eigenvalues, not the product.",

        "b": "Incorrect. 0 is not a valid eigenvalue here.",
        "c": "Incorrect. λ² = 4 would imply A² = 4I, not I.",
